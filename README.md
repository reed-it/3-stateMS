# EC989 Empirical Project where I estimated Malaysia's GDP using an AR(1) model, an MS(2)-AR(1) model, and an MS(3)-AR(1) model

## Code package: R. Rohijas (2025). Modelling Economic Regimes in Malaysia using 2-state and 3-state Markov Switching Model.

## Data for Empirical Project.
For this empirical project, we use the quarterly log of GDP data for Malaysia from 1979Q2 to 2023Q3 that is collected as part of the Global VAR (GVAR) database by Mohaddes and Raissi (2024).  
The data dictionary is available as part of the download package from the database or can be downloaded here (https://www.mohaddes.org/gvar)

##Estimation files
The full project script is uploaded together with the report under the file name “Project Script V2.R”. We model the Malaysia GDP growth using the AR(1) model, MS(2)-AR(1) model, and MS(3)-AR(1) model. Each step in process is labelled accordingly in the full project script.
Replication codes come without technical support of any kind.
